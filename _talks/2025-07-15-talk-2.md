Summary: The conventional view of oceanic crustal formation is that magma migrates from the mantle to a crustal magma reservoir, which erupts to the surface forming lava flows through narrow vertical dykes, together composing of the upper crust that is subsequently modified and thinned by faulting. This simple model invoking narrow vertical dyking stems from the observation of nearly continuous axial melt lenses (AMLs) beneath fast- to intermediate-spreading ridges and limited variation in upper crustal thickness along ridge axis. However, the available observations at slow-spreading ridges suggest that the AML is confined to central portion of ridge segments, challenging the conventional model of oceanic crustal accretion. By applying seismic full waveform inversion to ocean bottom seismometer refraction data from the ~70 km-long slow-spreading (full rate of 21 mm/year) Lucky Strike segment in the North Atlantic Ocean, here we show that although the crustal thickness varies from 8.4 km at the segment center to ~4 km at segment ends, the upper crustal thickness remains nearly constant (~3.0Â±0.3 km). The large variation in crustal thickness is dominantly due to the thinning of gabbroic lower crust, which accounts for ~2/3 of crustal thickness at the segment center but only 10% at segment ends. We suggest that most of the upper crust is formed by lateral dyke propagation from the melt-rich segment center to melt-poor segment ends. The petrology of basalts from the Lucky Strike segment indicates that melt is more primitive at the segment center and gets more evolved towards segment ends, supporting our interpretation.
