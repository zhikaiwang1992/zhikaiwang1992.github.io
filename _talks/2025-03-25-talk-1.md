Summary: The Lucky Strike segment at 37°N on the Mid‐Atlantic ridge, characterized by a well‐defined median valley with a central volcano, is an archetypical slow‐spreading ridge segment. By applying full waveform inversion to ocean bottom seismometer refraction data from this segment, we show that although the crustal thickness varies from 8.4 km at the segment centre to 3.9±0.2 km at segment ends, the upper crustal thickness remains nearly constant (3.0±0.3 km). The large variation in crustal thickness is dominantly due to the thinning of gabbroic lower crust, which accounts for ~2/3 of crustal thickness at the segment centre but only 10% at segment ends. We suggest that most of the upper crust is formed by lateral dyke propagation from the melt-rich segment centre to melt-poor segment ends. This indicates that the magmatic accretion along slow-spreading ridges is highly three-dimensional.
