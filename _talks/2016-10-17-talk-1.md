Summary: Converted wave seismic data processing and analysis can preserve and exploit the information carried by PP- and PS-wave. PP- and PS- reflection registration is a crucial step in joint PP and PS analysis and can provide the same depth/time domain seismic data for further interpretation. In this abstract, we solve the registration by combining pre-stack AVO inversion and dynamic time warping. Because of the waveform similarity between PS-wave section and pseudo-PS-wave section is between than that between PP- and PS-wave section, firstly a pre-stack inversion method is used to obtain a pseudo-PS-wave section based on pre- stack PP-wave gathers. Then dynamic time warping method based on waveform similarity is used to calculate the time shift and map the PS-wave section to PP-wave time domain. The method is used to synthetic data and field data and the results demonstrate shows a very good improvement in the event registration and this method is faster than cross-correlation method.
