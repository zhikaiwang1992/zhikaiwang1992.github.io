Summary: Based on the existing cell-node and cell-centered compact finite difference schemes, we developed a new central compact scheme with a high spectral resolution for the acoustic wave equation. In the new scheme, both the function values on the cell-nodes and cell-centers are used to compute the second-order spatial derivatives on the cell-nodes. The cell-centered values are stored and updated as independent variables in the modeling. The spatial derivatives on the cell-centers are evaluated by half shifting the indices in the formula designed for the cell-nodes. Compared to the conventional compact interpolation scheme, the proposed approach can avoid introducing transfer errors. Either Taylor-series expansion-based or optimized least-squares-based methods are used to calculate the finite difference coeï¬ƒcients. This new scheme can promise higher accuracy considering the same formal truncation errors and model parameters. Thus, it can maintain superior precision while using a shorter spatial finite difference stencil and yield equally as accurate results with less time consuming.
