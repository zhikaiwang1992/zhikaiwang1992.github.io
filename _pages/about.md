I am a Royal Society - Newton International Fellow at the University of Southampton, UK. As a geophysicist, my research in geoscience addresses the origin, formation and evolution of oceanic lithosphere, particularly the interactions among magmatic, tectonic and hydrothermal processes at mid-ocean ridges and the nature of transform faults bounding ridges. I use different techniques including bathymetry mapping, seismic travel time tomography and full waveform inversion, gravity inversion and geodynamic modelling.
