I am a postdoctoral research associate at Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, France. Before that, I worked as a Royal Society-Newton International Fellow at the University of Southampton, UK. As a geophysicist, my research in geoscience addresses the origin, formation and evolution of oceanic lithosphere, particularly the interactions among magmatic, tectonic and hydrothermal processes within mid-ocean ridge-transform fault systems. I use different geophysical techniques including bathymetry mapping, seismic modelling and inversion, gravity inversion and geodynamic modelling.
