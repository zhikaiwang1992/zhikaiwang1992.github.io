I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, France. Previously, I worked as a Royal Society-Newton International Fellow at the University of Southampton, UK. As a geophysicist, I investigate the formation and evolution of oceanic lithosphere, with a focus on the interactions between magmatic, tectonic, and hydrothermal processes in mid-ocean ridge-transform fault systems. I use a range of geophysical techniques, including bathymetry mapping, seismic modelling and inversion, gravity inversion and geodynamic modelling.
