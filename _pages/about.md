I am Zhikai Wang and now I am Newton international research fellow at the university of Southampton. I am a geoscientist and my research in geoscience addresses the origin, formation and evolution of oceanic lithosphere, particularly the interactions among magmatic, tectonic and hydrothermal processes at mid-ocean ridges and the nature of transform faults bounding ridges. I use different techniques including bathymetry mapping, seismic travel time and waveform inversion, gravity inversion and geodynamic modelling.
